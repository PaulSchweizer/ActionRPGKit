# ActionRpgKit

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PaulSchweizer/ActionRpgKit.svg?branch=master)

## Overview
A simle to use kit for creating Action RPGs. The Kit is meant to be used within the Unity Game Engine, but is designed to have no dependency to Unity. This ensures a clean separation of logic and implementation.

## Project Management
The corresponding Scrum board and ticket system is hosted on [Jira](https://paulschweizer.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=ARPG&rapidView=4&view=planning.nodetail).

Any strategy documents are maintained on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_5pqWUPN6WhX29nazlWNjRhN2c).

## Documentation
The [Code Documentation](https://paulschweizer.github.io/ActionRpgKit/) is created with doxygen.

## Developing
The development is (mostly) test driven. 
[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/PaulSchweizer/ActionRpgKit/branches) is set up to run the unittests with nunit on each push and pull-request.
